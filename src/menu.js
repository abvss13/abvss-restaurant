Try our Vegan Cheese Bowl with all the vegan cheese you want. Our tofu bowl has 1/4 cup vegan butter, 1/4 cup vegan soy cheese, 1/2 cup brown sugar. We use soy and coconut butter and try to use 100% in bulk (1 Tbsp to the amount you need for this bowl). As always, there is a limit on how much you can add, but if you\'re making them with almond milk or other dairy and butter substitutes, add 2 small bags.'

These vegetables are used for many foods and have a flavour as well and we believe they provide a delicious vegetarian friendly addition to your meal. We use whole cashews that our staff has cooked up for us since the days of the \'Cheese Bowl\' and have used it on this vegan pasta since we began manufacturing. Vegetarians and vegans alike are encouraged to try this vegan pasta and it will help you feel better about your diet. It makes us feel full and gives you the natural energy to eat more and more.'

A savory dessert that might not be all the way through a meal if not made on a pre-dinner night, this will likely please you, but it does bring the experience back at least a little to the evening. One of the most unique flavors in the sandwich is the bacon, and this is the perfect example of how this is often overlooked. This is a simple but delicious bacon sandwich, with a few twists and a dash of bacon sprinkled in the crust. The whole thing is served with a light touch of tomato, chia, or black pepper and served over a generous bowl of shredded carrots topped with extra lettuce and bacon. This is perfect with your favorite holiday dessert or any other year round breakfast.'
